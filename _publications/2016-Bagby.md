A novel chemical fingerprint identifies sediment samples contaminated with oil from <i>Deepwater Horizon</i>, and the loss rates of 125 hydrocarbon analytes in these samples show that contamination level strongly influences chemical structure-based trends in biodegradation kinetics.  Hydrocarbon geochemistry, statistics, more statistics.
